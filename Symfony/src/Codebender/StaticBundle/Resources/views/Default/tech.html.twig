			<h3>Cloud IDE</h3>
			<p>
				In essence, {{ site_name }} is an online IDE for makers, artists, makers, engineers and hardware
				enthusiasts. You can use it to program any Arduino-compatible device, and we hope to add support for
				other platforms that makers use (like the Stellaris Launchpad, Raspberry Pi, etc.) in the near future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being online, it only takes you a couple of minutes to get started with {{ site_name }}. We take care of all
				the requirements, and guide  you from zero to your first Arduino sketch, with a few clicks. Plus, you no
				longer have to install and maintain your tools across computers. {{ site_name }} takes care of all that.
				Just log in with your account and you're set.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you become a veteran Maker, you can also benefit from our shared libraries, our fast, cloud-based
				compiler, our easy-to-use, state of the art code editor, our remote flashing feature, and other things
				we have planned for the future.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<h3>Makers' Hub</h3>
			<p>
				On top of an IDE, {{ site_name }} is also a collaboration platform for Makers. A place where you can
				find, share, and exchange code, and ideas. Look for existing sketches, other peoples' implementations of
				what you'd like to build, share your own work, or even embed your code to your blogs and tutorials. We
				hope to help everyday people start their first project, become makers and advance technology instead of
				consuming it. Together, let's make the world a better place.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's a list of {{ site_name }}'s community features:

	    <h3>Code</h3>
	    <p>{{ site_name }} uses Ace, an awesome web code editor written in pure HTML5 and Javascript, which is the best thing ever since sliced bread, at least as far as code editors go. Use it now and enjoy indentation that just works™, great syntax highlighting, auto-completion, highlighting of matching parentheses and brackets and highlighting of a selected keyword. Oh, and of course, you can't call it an editor if it doesn't have Vim and EMACS keybindings. Built-in.</p>

	    <h3>Compile</h3>
	    <p>Compile your code, on the cloud. With {{ site_name }}, you can compile your code on our servers, saving you the hassle of downloading and installing all the necessary tools to build your sketches. No more upgrading to newer versions and managing incompatible library versions. This also improves compilation times in old machines and simplifies syntax error checks.</p>

	    <h3>Built-in Libraries</h3>
	    <p>Never mind about finding, installing, and updating external libraries anymore. With {{ site_name }}, you only need to include the library you want to use, and we automatically compile it with your code. And we also take care of updating them when a new version is released. All just for you. Stop worrying about libraries, and start coding your Arduino. That autonomous space BBQ laser grill isn't going to build itself, you know.</p>
